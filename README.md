## Environment
* Unreal Engine 4.27
* C++11

## Features
1. Utilizing **projection matrix** to process player input to accomplish one to one on player finger moving distance and character displacement for devices with different resolution and pixels
2. Implement **inheritance** on common functionalities shared by different types of enemies like applying damage on the superclass inherited by all enemy classes
3. Implement **dynamic polymorphism** when a player projectile overlaps with an enemy instance, different types of enemy receives different amount of damage
4. Implement **countdown system without internet** connection


## Lessons learned
1. Familiarize myself with C++ pointer and reference
2. Implement object oriented programming techniques, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Abstraction.
3. Unreal Engine is not an ideal tool for moible game development
4. Always document project process
5. Version control is a life-saver
